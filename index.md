## Research Interests

I am majoring in Electrical Engineering, with a keen interest in power system optimization and control. Besides, I possess a strong aptitude for mathematics and statistics, particularly in the realm of probability theory, which is why I am concurrently pursuing a minor degree in Statistics at Tsinghua University.
